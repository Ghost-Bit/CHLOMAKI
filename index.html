<p><br />Before you can understand an operating system for such an obscure handheld we should probably get into what the heck a CMT-PC5 actually is. <br />It's a handheld that runs a version of DOS. That operating system from 1980-Something where you had to type every command and program name in to run it, and didn't use a mouse. The CMT-PC5 is essentially what a computer from the early 90s would be, crammed into a shell which is reportedly as durable as a nokia, being able to withstand being dragged along a road and submerged in water, which are things you should never do with a computer anyways, but it's nice Corvallis Microtechnology went the extra mile to make this thing as immune to death as possible.</p>
<h1><strong><br />Why make an operating system for it?</h1></strong><p> to commemorate and make anyone else out there who may own this rare, elusive, strange device themselves's lives easier by giving them something other than SHELL and DOS's command line to use for operating this device.</p>
<h1><br><strong>Anything of note about the PC-5?</h1></strong><p>There's a few things about it i find unique.<br />1. It does has multiple screen modes, and seems to have different fonts for some of them. Screen mode 5 in particular is seemingly a literally double-width version of the regular DOS 8x8 font, which looks absolutely out of place on such a tiny screen, by default, it uses screen mode 3, sporting a font that seems to be 6x8 or something close to that. i, personally, don 't like the 6x8 font and wish there was a way to change it :/ <br />2. The key configuration doesn't play nice with specific DOS programs, such as QBASIC and JEdit. <br />3. You use SH1+Arrow Keys to move the "window" around, which allows you to use dos programs that would otherwise take up an entire screen, which unsuprisingly, the PC-5 doesn't have. This will be a nice challenge for my software development, and i hope it will give way to unique ideas.</p>

<h2>Project Updates...</h2>
<h3>2/24/22 - The Beginning Of The Thing</h3>The past 7 days have essentially been the birth of the project, starting off with a graphical BF interpreter for the PC-5 that takes advantage of the function key layout, as well as another file that serves as a template for not only what will become the "desktop" of GHOS, but for other applications as well, due to the formatting of it. This was already done to create the BF interpreter, as to be perfectly honest, i don't like the thought of having to type a 91-line long data statement containing a raw, binary-format version of the 3x5 pixel font twice. Weirdly enough, i have done more work on the BF interpreter than the actual app screen, but that was mostly to give myself applications to actually show on the apps screen when i start coding the brunt of the apps screen. I also went ahead and programed NEDT.BAS, a simple (but buggy as of now) program for editing 1-channel music. As of right now, that's pretty much it, below is a picture of the BF interpreter.
