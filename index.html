<p><br />Before you can understand an operating system for such an obscure handheld we should probably get into what the heck a CMT-PC5 actually is. <br />It's a handheld that runs a version of DOS. That operating system from 1980-Something where you had to type every command and program name in to run it, and didn't use a mouse. The CMT-PC5 is essentially what a computer from the early 90s would be, crammed into a shell which is reportedly as durable as a nokia, being able to withstand being dragged along a road and submerged in water, which are things you should never do with a computer anyways, but it's nice Corvallis Microtechnology went the extra mile to make this thing as immune to death as possible.</p>
<p><strong><br />Why make an operating system for it?</strong><br /> to commemorate and make anyone else out there who may own this rare, elusive, strange device themselves's lives easier by giving them something other than SHELL and DOS's command line to use for operating this device.</p>
